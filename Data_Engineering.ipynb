        "The features of Python\n",
        "1. high-level programming language focusing on readability, coherence and productivity. Python code is typically much less than the equivalent C++ or Java. That means less to type, less to debug and less to maintain.\n",
        "2. Most Python programes run unchanged on different computer platform porting Python code between Linux and Windows. \n",
        "3. A large collection of standard libraries. The Numpy extension is a free and more powerful equivalent to the Matlab numeric programming system.\n",
        "4. Python can be better described as a general purpose programming language that blends procedural, functional, and object-oriented paradigms.\n",
        "5. Relative lower execution speed compared to compiled and lower-level languages.Because Python compiles source code into an intermediated format known as byte code and then interpret the byte code, a platform-independent format.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Python interpreter works\n",
        "1. An interpreter is a program that executes other programs. Technically, the interpreter is a layer of software logic between your code and the computer hardward. \n",
        "2. Under the hood, Python compiles source code into a byte code. The byte code of the programs is stored in the files with *.pyc* extension.\n",
        "3. Sourcr changes: Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know whne it must recompile.\n",
        "4. If Python cannot write the byte code files to your machine, the program still works. The byte code is generated in memory and simply discarded on program exit. \n",
        "5. Once the program has been compiled to byte code, it is forwarded to execution by Python Virtual Machine. In fact, the PVM is a big loop that iterates through the byte code instructions. The PVM is the runtime engine of Python presenting as part of the Python system, and it truly runs your scripts.\n",
        "6. Python byte code is not binary machine code, it is a Python-specific representation. This is why some Python code may not run as fast as C or C++ code. The byte code instructions require more work than CPU instructions. On the other hand, unlike in classic intepreters, there is still an internal compile step.\n",
